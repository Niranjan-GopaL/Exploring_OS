# Viva Prep

- PIPE : unidirectional communication channel for IPC





---

# Ultimate Idea
- Maybe make THE ULTIMATE SHELL SCRIPT
- it automatically compiles executable for all 30 files
- AND THEN AUTOMATICALLY DOES A DEMO FOR EACH executable 
  ( since a lot of executable expect user input, it can't be completely automatic )
- done


# have a gif generated to show demo
- done

# Make a small documentation
- no time

# Maybe have a decription of what the prorgam is doing at the top of each file
- useless

# take user_input from environment in 12 14
- done

# Issues
./30 adnd ./27 does not work ;
there are ./8 which I think is mnot written in correct way
