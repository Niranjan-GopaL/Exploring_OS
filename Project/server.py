"""
This is the server-side file for the Online Library Management System (OLMS).

For students, the following functionalities are provided:
    1. Authenticate student by username and password.
    2. Search for and borrow books.
    3. View the list of borrowed books.

For admins, the following functionalities are provided:
    1. Authenticate admin using a password.
    2. Modify book records: add, delete, or search for books.
    3. Access student information and manage new student records.

The server communicates with multiple clients using socket programming, ensuring concurrent access to the library database stored in CSV format. Data consistency is maintained through file-locking mechanisms.
